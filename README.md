# Fulltext-Search-PostgreSQL
Pretty simple Java wrapper for PostgreSQL fulltext search feature.

# Introduction
What is Full-Text Search.

First, let's look at the definition:

>In text retrieval, full-text search refers to techniques for searching a single computer-stored document or a collection in a full-text database. The full-text search is distinguished from searches based on metadata or on parts of the original texts represented in databases.
>-- Wikipedia

This definition introduces the concept of a document, which is important. When you run a search across your data, you are looking into meaningful entities for which you want to search, these are your documents! The PostgreSQL documentation explains it amazingly.

>A document is the unit of searching in a full-text search system; for example, a magazine article or email message.
?-- Postgres documentation

This document can be across multiple tables and it represents a logical entity which we want to search for.
